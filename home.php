                <p>The sport. The big waves. The dreamy beaches. Surfing has still to be dethroned.  However, the behind-the-scenes are more than concerning.

<br>Otitis, gastroenteritis, skin irritations. Three diseases that one over three surfers confirmed having it after only one session.  All year long, the water is infected by two types of pollution : bacteriological and chemical. With that, there's also the trash. They are everywhere. More than the view, they can have a dangerous physical impact on the surfers ( the person who wrote this text in french almost got hit by a toilet bowl! )

To act again such risks, Surfrider wishes for the littorals to be more monitored all year long. Nowadays, it's only done in summer as it got imposes by the UE. To back up our claims, we need datas about the practice of the surfers, their frequency, their exposure times and their observation of a given place.
